As any minimally superstitious person knows all too well, terrible things will happen when four persons
do a crossed handshake.
You, an intrepid computer scientist, are given the task of easing the burden of these people by
providing them with the feasible set of handshakes that include everyone in the group while avoiding
any such crossings. The following figure illustrates the case for 3 pairs of persons:

-----------------------------------------

Let f(i) denote the number of handshakes in i pairs.

How many choices does the first person have ?
He can shake hands with the fourth person from his right.

That is given by f(1).f(n - 1)
He may shake hands with two people after that. It is f(2).f(n - 2)

f(n + 1) = sum(f(i). f(n - i))

This is a catalan number given by 1/(n + 1) . choose (2n, n)

Can be computed in O(n) time using careful multiplication.

int main()
{
    int n;

    for(int i = 1; scanf("%d", &n) != EOF; i++)
    {
        if(i > 1) printf("\n");

        long long answer = 1LL;

        for(int i = 0; i <= n - 1; i++)
            answer = (answer*(2*n - i))/(i + 1);

        answer = answer/(n + 1);

        printf("%lld\n", answer);
    }
    return 0;
}
